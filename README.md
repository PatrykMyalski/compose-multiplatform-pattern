## About
Starter for KMM Compose multiplatform design.

This project provides a starting point for creating multiplatform projects using KMM Compose. 
It includes support for both light and dark modes on both iOS and Android platforms, along with dynamic theming for Android. 
To make color customization easy, you can utilize this [tool](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom) to generate colors in the Material3 fashion.

Compatibility: This project works with Java 17.

To configure the Java version in Android Studio:
1. Go to Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle.
2. Set the Gradle JDK to your preferred version. I am using the JetBrains Runtime version 17.0.6.
